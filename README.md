## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Description

In this application, a user is presented with a daily scheduler which will help let them input tasks and plan their day accordingly. Each hour is color-coded, with gray representing tasks in the past, red as the current hour and green as any future hours. Even if the user leaves the page or refreshes it, the tasks will still remain.
